# Educare
This is a simple demostration of using HTML,CSS, Javascript and bootstrap tp design the UI of a web page. I havenot used any special libraries or frameworks andthe backend of this project is under development.
This is the first project i have build the concept is to provide material with detials to the student and also practise the basics of building and styling a web page.
This will help any beginner student to start the journey of web development and learn the basics feel free to access the codes and connect together. #Tag me if i am able to help you with this.
